NeuroTrack created a computational algortithm to perform a content-agnostic analysis of the timing of pressing and releasing keystrokes during a controlled series of trials. Combining this information with the patient's medical record, we were able to use machine learning to identify biomarkers of functional impairments in motor development and cognition. A decline in motor function and congition can be an indicator of neurodegenrative disease progression.
